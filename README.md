## 🌟 Overview

Writing modern long-form content requires more than basic LLM text generation. Top-performing articles must satisfy **Traditional Search Engines (Google SEO)**, **Generative AI Citation Engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Gemini AI Overviews)**, and **Discerning Human Readers**.

`topic-to-blog` orchestrates an autonomous 5-phase production pipeline backed by specialized modular sub-skills to produce publication-ready content with real data, custom visual diagrams, structured comparison matrices, and authentic human cadence.

## 🚀 The 5-Phase Production Pipeline

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Topic + Brief Context] --> B[Phase 1: Deep Research]
    B --> C[Phase 2: SEO & GEO Blueprint]
    C --> D[Phase 3: Structural Synthesis & Drafting]
    D --> E[Phase 4: Humanizer & Voice Engineering]
    E --> F[Phase 5: CORE-EEAT Audit & Delivery]
    F --> G[🚀 Publication-Ready Blog Post]
```

### 1. 🔍 Deep Research (`references/deep-research/`)
- **Landscape Mapping & Dimension Drilldowns**: Explores 3–5 key architectural and thematic dimensions.
- **4 Core Information Types**: Systematically gathers:
  - **Facts & Data**: Concrete statistics, benchmark metrics with units (%, ms, $, GB), sample sizes, and dates.
  - **Examples & Case Studies**: Real-world production implementations and war stories.
  - **Expert Debates**: Consensus views and contrarian technical trade-offs.
  - **Future Trajectories**: 12-to-36-month horizon projections.
- **Synthesis Quality Gate**: Zero drafting on assumptions or single search queries.

### 2. 🎯 SEO & Generative Engine Optimization (`references/seo-geo/`)
- **Search Intent & Keyword Mapping**: Targets high-intent queries with 3–5 conversational long-tail variants.
- **GEO Direct Answer Engine**: Crafts high-density direct answers (<150 words) right below the title/intro to maximize citations by AI answer engines.
- **Archetype Template Selection**: Automatically selects from 4 tailored templates in `references/blog-archetypes.md`:
  - *Archetype 1*: Deep-Dive Technical / Conceptual Guide
  - *Archetype 2*: Opinionated Thought Leadership & Strategic Essay
  - *Archetype 3*: Comparative Breakdown & Benchmark Matrix
  - *Archetype 4*: Case Study & Practical How-To Walkthrough
- **CORE-EEAT Compliance**: Follows the 8 core quality dimensions (Clarity, Organization, Referenceability, Exclusivity, Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust).

### 3. 🛠️ Deep Drafting & Structural Synthesis
- **No Generic Openings**: Bans throat-clearing intros (*"In today's fast-paced digital world..."*) in favor of immediate hooks and problems.
- **Visual Architecture**: Generates custom **Mermaid diagrams** (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, architecture maps).
- **Structured Tables & Code**: Embeds side-by-side comparison matrices and runnable code snippets with language syntax highlighting.

### 4. 🧠 Humanizer Engine (`references/humanizer/`)
- **24 AI Slop Anti-Patterns Eradicated**: Purges significance inflation (*"stands as a testament"*), trailing `-ing` clauses, banned vocabulary (*delve*, *utilize*, *transformative*, *plethora*, *beacon*, *tapestry*), and weasel attributions.
- **Voice, Rhythm & Nuance**: Mixes short punchy sentences with rhythmic analytical prose, grounded opinions on trade-offs, and natural first/second-person perspectives.

### 5. ✅ CORE-EEAT Audit & Multi-Format Delivery
- **Pre-Publish Quality Check**: Rigorous verification against `references/quality-checklist.md`.
- **Deliverables**: Markdown with full YAML frontmatter, with optional exports to DOCX, PDF, interactive HTML web artifacts, and custom visual hero images.
